# Basic Butt Manager ![Smiling Peach](../resources/favicon24.png)

A basic wrapper around qdot's amazing [haptics library](https://github.com/buttplugio/buttplug-csharp), with the aim of providing a simple interface for integrating adult toy controls into Unity games / .NET applications (e.g. through mods). Not suitable for complex projects!

## Usage

To set all connected toys to half intensity:

1. Launch [Intiface :copyright: Central](https://intiface.com/central/) (with default server settings).
2. Add this [.dll](https://github.com/MLTorches/BasicButtManager/releases/tag/v1.0.3) to your project's references (or install from [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/BasicButtManager/)).
3. Somewhere in your code...

```
BasicButtManager manager = new BasicButtManager("Love Rhythm");
manager.Set(0.5f);
manager.Exit();
```

## WARNING

If you are MODDING an existing project, please use [ButtServer](https://github.com/MLTorches/ButtServer) + [ButtClient](https://www.nuget.org/packages/ButtClient) instead.

### Explanation

***This is a lower-level, framework-dependent (.NET 4) package meant for developers working on their own projects where they can control the underlying framework.*** For example, there are some compatibility issues between certain packages used by (the dependencies of) the underlying Buttplug package and some versions of the .NET framework.

This concern is taken care off under the hood automatically by the ***Butt Server***, which is a standalone executable tested and known to work with [Buttplug](https://github.com/buttplugio/buttplug-csharp). The ***Butt Client*** (which you as a modder will hook into the existing game/application) then uses bare minimum socket logic to communicate with ButtServer, independent of any potential framework-dependent libraries.

### Communication Path

The typical communication path goes like this:

```text
Existing Unity Game --> BepinEx + Harmony --> ButtClient --> ButtServer --> BasicButtManager --> Intiface Central --> Toys
      (C# hook)                                 (.dll)         (.exe)            (.dll)               (.exe)    
```           

So once again, DO NOT expect to just plug this .dll into an existing Unity game on Steam and just expect it to work!
It works just wonderfully fine though if you are creating your own .NET 4 project from scratch. Have fun modding! <3
